# Image Classification Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on image classification using two different convolutional neural network (CNN) models:
- **Custom CNN Model**
- **VGG16 Pre-trained Model**

The goal is to compare the performance of these models in classifying images into their respective categories. The project also includes a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit to visualize predictions and a presentation summarizing the work.

## Files and Directories
The Google Drive folder contains the following files:

1. **cnn_model.h5** — The trained custom CNN model.
2. **vgg16_model.h5** — The trained VGG16 model.
3. **app.py** — Streamlit app for image classification.
4. **project_presentation.pdf** — Presentation summarizing the project.

## Model Comparison
The project includes a detailed comparison between the custom CNN and VGG16 models, evaluating them based on accuracy, loss, and other relevant metrics.
