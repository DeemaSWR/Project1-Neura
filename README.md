#Image Classification Project

Project Overview

This project focuses on image classification using two different convolutional neural network (CNN) models:

Custom CNN Model

VGG16 Pre-trained Model

The goal is to compare the performance of these models in classifying images into their respective categories. The project also includes a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit to visualize predictions and a presentation summarizing the work.
